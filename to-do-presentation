✅ 1. README.md
Your README is your project's handshake. Make it clear, inviting, and informative. Include:

Project name + short description

Screenshots (optional, but powerful)

How to run it locally

Python version

Required environment variables

pip install -r requirements.txt

How to set up the database

Features

Example: “Add/view daily appointments, input validation, dynamic form rendering, etc.”

Optional: Future improvements (like JS interactivity or better styling)

✅ 2. requirements.txt
You mentioned earlier that you hadn’t used it yet — it’s super easy:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip freeze > requirements.txt
This lets others (or future-you) install exactly what you used:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
✅ 3. .gitignore
Make sure you’re not committing things like:

.venv/

__pycache__/

.env files with secrets (use .env.example instead)

✅ 4. Folder Structure
It sounds like your structure is already modular (using app/, templates/, etc.) — that’s great. Just keep it clean and logical.

✅ 5. Optional: Demo
If you ever want to impress even more:

Record a short GIF or video walking through the app.

Deploy it to a free platform like Render, Fly.io, or Railway (Heroku used to be great for this, but it’s more limited now).
